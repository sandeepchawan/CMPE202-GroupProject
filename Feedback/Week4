Feedback:
This weeks meeting was very productive. The team was not very sure if we can implement the project in Greenfoot. But after trying out several methods and implementing few functions we decided to develop the game in Greenfoot and HTML5 simultaneously so that whichever turns out to be the best can be considered to be submitted. Also, we started our coding and decided on the UI for the application. HTML5 can be used to make the UI very user friendly and attractive. But we are also trying to implement the same on Greenfoot which needs much more effort compared to HTML5 but since everyone agreed on developing the application on Greenfoot. We started building up the UI. For now, we just started off with the basic stuff. We decided that next week, we will try to meet up few times more than usual and finish most of the project so that the ending part can be designed carefully in order to avoid errors and other problems in the last week. Also, everyone is putting in their efforts and giving various ideas to improve the efficiency of the project which is very important at this stage of the project. If we could go at this pace for the  next two weeks, the team would be able to complete the project and present it at the end of fourth week without any problems.
