XP value: Respect 

In this week, we have started off with developing two versions of our game-one in processing ide and one using html5/jquery. We have subdivided our teams in two groups to work on the two versions of our game. There were a lot of inputs given by each of us regarding the implementation of our compression box and to drag/drop the words into it. We have met a couple of times and explored the various jquery libraries and tried our hand at some of them to check which one is suitable to our game. We have discussed the implementation of our algorithm by brainstorming each idea given by the team. We discussed the possible use of different data structures like ArrayList, HashMaps in our algorithm and how effectively we can implement the text compression using these data structures. We discussed various complexities involved in our implementation like mapping the position of each repeating word to the compressed string and to retrieve the actual word after decompression. Finally,we were able to drag and drop the string to the compression box in both processing and Html5. We restructured our backlog items for the following week by prioritizing the items. We decided to make 2 working versions of our game in processing and Html5. We divided our work into various modules like working on the ui/animation, implementing the algorithm, drag/drop of the strings among ourselves and combine our modules in the end. We also had a discussion regarding the implementation of multi-player as there was an option to implement this feature in processing environment and also on docker cloud/aws. We decided that we are going to implement our algorithm in the second sprint cycle.
