# CMPE202-GroupProject

The purpose of this project is to design a game to teach computational thinking to people from non-CS background.

We have developed a multiplayer game 'Compresso' which demonstrates the topic 'Text Compression'.
The game development is done using HTML/Javascript on the client side, Node.js on the server side. 
Socket.io libraries have been used to for client/server communication. 
The game app has been deployed on Heroku and has been scaled to multiple users.
We have used few design patterns such as facade, strategy, iterator, decorator, factory in our project.
